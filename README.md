## Dobondi David, Frontend Developer 💻

As a Frontend Developer, I enjoy crafting modern websites that are not only beautifully designed but also fast and reliable. I excel at creating responsive designs, accessible content for everybody, optimized pages for search engines (SEO) and powerful performant websites. My daily tools are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, but I am passionate about learning something new every day, whether it's a fresh technology, a brilliant design concept or a handy trick. I believe that a lot of people's lives have been improved and can further be enhanced by the benefits of our World Wide Web, therefore I want to contribute my fair share to its development.
